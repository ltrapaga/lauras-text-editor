# Laura's Text Editor

## Description

Laura's Text Editor is a single-page application that uses manifests, service workers, and IndexedDB to function similarly to a native app and meet the Progessive Web App (PWA) criteria. The application is fully functional offline and features a number of data persistence techniques in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. Visit <https://lauras-pwa-text-editor.herokuapp.com/> to start testing the performance of a PWA text editor!
